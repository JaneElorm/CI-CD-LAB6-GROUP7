                    <p>Hello! I'm Mawuena Dede, a computer science student at Ashesi University with a passion for technology and innovation.</p>
                    <p>I developed a fascination for computers and how they work. This curiosity has led me to pursue a degree in computer science, where I've gained valuable knowledge and skills in software development, data structures, algorithms, and more.</p>
                    <p>I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies and expand my skillset.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I'm focusing on honing my skills in web development, machine learning, and cybersecurity, with the goal of making a positive impact in these fields.</p>
                    <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!</p>
